DESCRIPTION
    This module likes Try::Lite. But supports exception class prefix. Many
    times to write the same prefix is redundant is not it?

INTERFACE
  Functions
   "try"
    see Try::Lite. However, this function you can omit the prefix that you
    specified. If you want to write the name of the class if full, please
    put a + at the beginning.

    # TODO

DEPENDENCIES
    Perl 5.8.1 or later.
